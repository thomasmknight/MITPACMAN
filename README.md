MITPACMAN

Basic coding project to display PacMan in the browser

Currently, PacMan moves back and forth across the browser window. He has no food to eat, no enemies to run from or chase, no friends, and no Ms PacMan. He is alone, caught between invisible lines he does not comprehend.
Soon I hope to change all that! 

For now, make him go faster by clicking on him, and click on the PacMan logo to learn more.
